# What's Inversion-of-Control (IoC)
The `Inversion-of-Control` (**IoC**) pattern, is about providing any kind of callback (which controls reaction), instead of acting ourself directly (in other words, inversion and/or redirecting control to external handler/controller). The `Dependency-Injection` (**DI**) pattern is a more specific version of IoC pattern, and is all about removing dependencies from your code.
> Every **DI** implementation can be considered **IoC**, but one should not call it **IoC**, because implementing `Dependency-Injection` is harder than callback (Don't lower your product's worth by using general term "**IoC**" instead).

For **DI** example, say your application has a text-editor component, and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this:
```
public class TextEditor {

private SpellChecker checker;

    public TextEditor() {
        this.checker = new SpellChecker();
    }
}
```
What we've done here creates a dependency between the `TextEditor` and the `SpellChecker`. In an **IoC** scenario we would instead do something like this:
```
public class TextEditor {

private IocSpellChecker checker;

    public TextEditor(IocSpellChecker checker) {
        this.checker = checker;
    }
}
```
In the first code example we are instantiating `SpellChecker` (`this.checker = new SpellChecker();`), which means the `TextEditor` class directly depends on the `SpellChecker` class.<br/><br/>In the second code example we are creating an abstraction by having the `SpellChecker` dependency class in `TextEditor`'s constructor signature (not initializing dependency in class). This allows us to call the dependency then pass it to the `TextEditor` class like so:
```
SpellChecker sc = new SpellChecker(); // dependency
TextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor(sc);
```
Now the client creating the `TextEditor` class has control over which `SpellChecker` implementation to use because we're injecting the dependency into the `TextEditor` signature.<br/><br/>Â© [stack**overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3140)
